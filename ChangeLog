2002-06-21  Daniel Elstner  <daniel.elstner@gmx.net>

2002-06-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* style.css: Specified foreground color, as suggested by
	Morten and jsado@attbi.com.

2002-06-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* cvs.shtml: Added link to developer.gnome.org cvs docs.
	* bugs.shtml: Added link to cvs.shtml and added text about
	patching ChangeLog and creating simple-as-possible examples.

2002-06-22  Morten Brix Pedersen  <morten@wtf.dk>

	* Merged requirements into download.

2002-06-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* requirements.shtml: Corrected.
	* license.shtml: Added GNU links and added some text countering
	LGPL/GPL confusion and some more subtle QT bashing.
	
2002-06-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* download.shtml: Use simpler download URL which only shows
	latest versions.
	* developers.shtml: Added Morten and Jarek.
	
2002-06-21  Morten Brix Pedersen  <morten@wtf.dk>

	* Bug #80195:
	* Used CSS Positioning instead of tables. There is now much less
	repetition of HTML - TEMPLATE.shtml is now incredibly small, and
	we should be able to change parts of the design just by changing
	the style.css file.
	* Added images/gtkmm_logo_small.png.
	* Redesigned layout.
	
2002-06-19  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Added statement.shtml from old site.

2002-06-19  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* fragments/footer.html_fragment: Removed most little icon links to
	sourceforge stuff that we don't use anymore.
	* Changed upload path to main htdocs - this site is now live.

2002-06-19  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Added the other .shtml pages.
	* Used fragment/html_declaration.html_fragment to avoid some
	duplication.
	* Added TEMPLATE.shtml - just copy it to make a new top-level
	page. It has "Your text here" parts.
	* Simplified menu:
	  - Not hierarchical.
	  - Documentation just points to our documentation overview page.

2002-06-19  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Created gnomemm/website in gnome cvs.
	* Recreated front page as SSI: index.shtml is a simple <table>
	that #includes HTML code from fragments/*.html_fragments. The
	other pages will still duplicate some <table> code, but it won't
	be too much and it should be easy to understand.
