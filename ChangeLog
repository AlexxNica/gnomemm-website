	http://webclass.csuchico.edu/fc/COURSES/219/notes/makefile.html

2002-06-23  Daniel Elstner  <daniel.elstner@gmx.net>

2002-06-21  Morten Brix Pedersen  <morten@wtf.dk>

	* Bug #80195:
	* Used CSS Positioning instead of tables. There is now much less
	repetition of HTML - TEMPLATE.shtml is now incredibly small, and
	we should be able to change parts of the design just by changing
	the style.css file.
	* Added images/gtkmm_logo_small.png.
	* Redesigned layout.
	
2002-06-19  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

2002-06-19  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

2002-06-19  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Added the other .shtml pages.
	* Used fragment/html_declaration.html_fragment to avoid some
	duplication.
	* Added TEMPLATE.shtml - just copy it to make a new top-level
	page. It has "Your text here" parts.
	* Simplified menu:
	  - Not hierarchical.
	  - Documentation just points to our documentation overview page.

2002-06-19  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Created gnomemm/website in gnome cvs.
	* Recreated front page as SSI: index.shtml is a simple <table>
	that #includes HTML code from fragments/*.html_fragments. The
	other pages will still duplicate some <table> code, but it won't
	be too much and it should be easy to understand.
